# 🧠 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification - Scikit-learn Implementation

## 📌 Objective
Understand and implement the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for classification problems using Python’s Scikit-learn library. This project uses the Iris dataset to demonstrate the concept of instance-based learning and explores decision boundaries and model accuracy.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

---

## 📂 Dataset
We use the **Iris dataset**, a classic multi-class classification problem with three flower species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has 4 numerical features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

---

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Open the code in **Google Colab**.
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and explore the dataset
   - Normalize features
   - Train-test split
   - Fit KNN model
   - Predict and evaluate performance
   - Visualize 2D decision boundaries
   - Analyze how accuracy changes with different `K` values

---

## 🧪 Experimentation
You can tweak:
- `n_neighbors` (K value) to test model flexibility
- Feature pairs for different 2D boundary plots
- Different datasets from `sklearn.datasets` or use your own via CSV

---

## 📊 Output Highlights
- Accuracy score on the test set
- Confusion matrix for classification performance
- Decision boundaries visualized in 2D (using first 2 features)
- Accuracy plot for `K` from 1 to 20

---

## 📈 Visualization Samples
- **Decision Boundaries**: Colored plots showing model's classification zones
- **Elbow Plot**: Line graph displaying accuracy vs. K

---

## ✅ Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy Score**: Fraction of correct predictions
- **Confusion Matrix**: Matrix showing true vs. predicted labels

---

## 📚 Further Ideas
- Add `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning
- Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Try with `make_moons`, `make_circles`, or `digits` datasets
